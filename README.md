This repository contains my completed tasks for the JPMC Software Engineering Job Simulation on Forage.

• Tasks Implemented:
Backend Development: Integrated a Kafka Consumer to process real-time transaction streams.

API Design: Built a REST API using Spring Boot to handle balance inquiries.

Testing: Ensured data consistency between the transaction stream and the user database.

Note: This project was completed as part of a virtual job simulation to learn enterprise-level backend architecture.
